# Views

See http://techiferous.com/2012/05/experimenting-with-the-architecture-of-ember-js/
for a description of a useful architecture for managing views via bindings.

Extract:

... some application state does not need to be persisted, such as which tab is selected or a currently selected item in a list. To distinguish between these two types of objects, objects that are meant to be persisted I call Storables and objects that are used to remember the display state I call Viewables.

When the state of the application changes, the display needs to be updated. Ember.js provides a wonderful mechanism for this, called Bindings. So Bindings are the mechanism for the state layer to affect the display layer.

For the display layer to affect the state layer, I created a new type of object called a Handler. Controls are always hooked up to a Handler. A Handler receives the action generated by the Control and, in response, changes the state of a Viewable or Storable. Thatâ€™s all a Handler does: receives an action from the display, responds by changing state. Ideally, it has no knowledge of the DOM.
